I got to say, "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker", has proved me wrong. It's an absolute best final chapter, and far more better than Rian Johnson's "Star Wars: The Last Jedi", because J.J. Abrams and George Lucas has delivered all the great experience in the film, and has delivered the greatest lightsaber duel of all time, that Rian Johnson couldn't deliver in the Last Jedi. There's nothing like the Star Wars series. Episode IX is the final chapter that has a conclusion to the story that is over 40 years of a making. At the beginning of 1977's Star Wars: A New Hope, these are all the story of all 8 Star Wars films to get to Episode IX that is the final chapter of the Skywalker Saga, it has to be Inevitable, Satisfying, Emotional, and Thrilling. J.J. Abrams and George Lucas wants the whole world to see what it's like to feel the ending of Star Wars, as the force will call to us, between the light and the dark side, and we will all feel the force once again. All the main characters and the original characters come together for one very last time for the final saga to end, and it's like nothing you've ever seen before. The previous story of Star Wars have all build and lead to this very last moment. It will go out with a bang, and there is a massive energy to it, that's bigger than anything that I could ever imagine. And it has all the fun. All the excitement, and all the sci-fi action/adventure you'll have to experience in the galaxy, far, far, away...
